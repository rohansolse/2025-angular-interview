<h2>User List with OnPush + trackBy</h2>
<p>
  Open your browser's developer console. When the component loads, you'll see
  <code>trackBy</code> log for each user. When you click "Add User", you'll see
  the log only for the new user, proving Angular isn't re-rendering the whole
  list.
</p>

<button (click)="addUser()">Add User</button>

<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let user of users; trackBy: trackByUser">
    ID: {{ user.id }} - Name: {{ user.name }}
  </li>
</ul>
